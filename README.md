### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

By day a **Ruby on Rails** developer, crafting web applications on the backend. I also explore mobile and other technologies, to see what's new. Check out my GitHub repositories for a glimpse into my coding adventures! ðŸš€

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm diving into iOS with SwiftUI. Why? Because I'm on a mission to create something truly exciting! âœ¨
