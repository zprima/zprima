### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm mostly a **Ruby on Rails** developer. I also try out other technologies. Check my repositories on Github for all the things I randomly code. I also have a [Medium](https://medium.com/@anMagpie) page. Feel free to give a me a follow there.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently re-learning **.NET C#** so I can try to make something exciting with **.NET MAUI.** :star2:
