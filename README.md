### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

By day a **Ruby on Rails** developer. I also explore mobile and other web technologies, to see what's new. Check my repositories on Github for all the things I randomly code. I also have a [Medium](https://primasky.medium.com) page.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android Develpment with **Jetpack Compose** so I can try to make something exciting with it :star2:<br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various apps that would help me better understand Compose
