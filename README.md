### Hi there 👋

By day a **Ruby on Rails** developer. I also explore mobile and other web technologies, to see what's new. Check my repositories on Github for all the things I randomly code.

🌱 I’m currently learning Android Develpment with **Jetpack Compose** and iOS with SwiftUI so I can try to make something exciting with it :star2:<br>
